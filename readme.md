## `10kb.site`
```
10kb.site is a write-only public text server.
You can upload any text you want at any file
path, as long as it's less than 10kb.


Files can never be changed or updated (except this one).
Files are deleted after 1 day.

### Status, plans

This service was initially created as an experiment, but it now serves a purpose, allowing one-way connections with [WebTTY](https://github.com/maxmcd/webtty). It would be nice if something like this could exist. I hope some combination of ip-rate limiting and quick expirations will keep most abuse opportunites at bay. We'll see. 

The current api and constraints are subject to change.
